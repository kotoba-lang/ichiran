(ns ichiran.resend
  "Opt-in REAL email Distributor for `ichiran.tallyport/publish!`, wired to
  Resend (the same provider `cloud-itonami.mail` already depends on — see
  that ns for the proven `jvm-http-fn`/`send-message-via-resend!`/
  `resend-api-key` shape this namespace mirrors).

  `ichiran.tallyport/mock-tallyport` stays the actor's DEFAULT — this ns is
  never reached unless a caller explicitly constructs and injects
  `(resend-tallyport store {:from ...})` via `ichiran.operation/build`'s
  `:tallyport` opt (ADR-2607062030 Consequences: real Distributor clients
  need per-provider API tokens/live binding, closed here for Resend only).

  Attachment format: `kotoba-lang/sheets` has no CSV/xlsx export (checked
  directly — `sheets.model`/`sheets.wire` only offer the Transit JSON wire
  envelope). `publish!` therefore attaches the same best-effort
  `sheets.wire/workbook-envelope` Kotoba Transit JSON `ichiran.tallyport`'s
  `mock-tallyport` already produces for its wire preview — here it becomes
  the actual delivered attachment instead of a preview, base64-encoded per
  Resend's `attachments[].content` contract. The email BODY is a small
  human-readable text summary of the workbook's tabs/cells (built from
  `sheets.model`'s own public accessors) so a recipient can read the report
  without opening the attachment.

  JSON: `mail.message`/`mailer.core` are provider-agnostic and never touch
  JSON; this ns is the one place (like `cloud_itonami.mail`) that actually
  encodes/decodes the wire body and touches the network. It uses
  `kotoba-lang/json` (`kotoba.lang.json`, the pure-Clojure encode/decode at
  the sha ichiran already pulls in transitively via `langgraph`→
  `langchain`) rather than adding a new third-party JSON dep — same 'stays
  dependency-free' reasoning `ichiran.kotoba`'s docstring gives for
  injecting JSON fns instead of hard-depending on one. Unlike
  `cloud_itonami.mail`'s cheshire, `kotoba.lang.json/decode` returns STRING
  keys (`(get resp-body \"id\")`, not `(:id resp-body)`) — see its own
  docstring.

  Ledger: on a successful send, the Resend message id is recorded on the
  artifact's `:draft` store record as `:tool (str \"resend:\" id)` — the
  ichiran analog of `cloud_itonami.mail`'s `:itonami.effect/tool
  (str \"resend:\" id)` pattern — plus a `:delivered` ichiran ledger fact,
  both via the SAME `store` the actor already writes through
  (`ichiran.store/record-datom!`/`append-ledger!`). This ns does NOT touch
  `ichiran.operation`'s shared StateGraph commit path — the mock default's
  behavior (and its tests) are completely unaffected either way; only a
  caller that actually injects `resend-tallyport` gets these extra facts."
