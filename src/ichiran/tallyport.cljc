(ns ichiran.tallyport
  "TallyTarget port — where a tally workbook draft becomes a *real* delivered
  report. A tally-LLM proposal is data (a `:draft` record, content = a
  sheets.model workbook EDN item) until a human approves it; `publish!` is
  called exactly once, after that approval, by `ichiran.operation`'s commit
  step — the actuation (best-effort Transit export + handing the result to
  an injected Distributor). `propose-revision!` is the 'casual commit' analog
  (teian's deckport/koyomi's scheduleport): recording that a draft candidate
  exists, no external effect yet.

  `mock-tallyport` is the default — a deterministic in-memory target so the
  actor is runnable/testable with no network/creds (ADR-2607062030
  Consequences: real Distributor clients need per-provider API tokens, live
  binding is out of scope here). `publish!` exports the workbook via
  `kotoba-lang/sheets`'s `sheets.wire/workbook-envelope` (Kotoba Transit
  JSON) — best-effort: malformed content or any failure to encode simply
  degrades to no envelope bytes rather than failing the whole delivery (a
  wire preview is a nicety, not the actuation itself). The Distributor is a
  plain injected fn — ichiran does not ship a live email/Slack/BI-tool
  client; the default just records what WOULD have been distributed.

  `slack-tallyport` below is one such opt-in Distributor (Slack
  `chat.postMessage`, alongside a separately-landing Resend-email one) —
  still not a replacement for mock-tallyport, just another
  `distribute-fn` a caller may inject into it. See README's 'Slack
  Distributor (owner setup required)' section for what the human owner
  still has to do (register a Slack app, obtain a bot token) before it is
  usable; no live Slack call is made anywhere in this repo, including its
  test suite."

(defn slack-tallyport
  "A Slack `chat.postMessage` Distributor for `mock-tallyport`'s
  `distribute-fn` slot — an opt-in alternative to the default no-op,
  alongside (not replacing) a Resend-email Distributor landing separately.
  Usage: `(mock-tallyport (atom {}) (slack-tallyport {:token \"xoxb-...\" :channel \"C0123...\"}))`.

  `:token` (Slack bot token) and `:channel` (target channel id) are
  owner-supplied constructor params — see README's 'Slack Distributor
  (owner setup required)' section; NEVER hardcoded or env-guessed here.

  Posts exactly one `chat.postMessage` per `publish!` call: a short text
  notification (the workbook's `:sheets/title` + a note a tally report was
  published, and whether a Transit envelope export was attempted) —
  never the workbook bytes themselves. Attaching the actual envelope would
  need Slack's separate, more complex `files.upload` multipart endpoint,
  which is out of scope here (a text notification is the honest scope of
  this scaffold — see README for the follow-up).

  The per-call `:target` (this actor's generic recipient field, e.g. an
  email address for the Resend Distributor) is intentionally NOT used for
  channel routing — Slack delivery is a fixed operational binding (the bot
  must already be invited to a channel, or have `chat:write.public`), not a
  per-message address the way email is; `:channel` is fixed at
  construction instead.

  `:http-fn` / `:json-write` are injected for testability (default: a real
  java.net.http POST / the minimal encoder above) — no live Slack call
  happens anywhere in this repo's automated test suite (there is no bot
  token to call with yet)."
