  "Demo: drive a tally workbook draft/publish through one TallyActor.

    ingest              register an artifact (observe → ground fact)
    draft act-finance-q3   clean, known tenant → phase 3 auto-commits (a casual commit)
    publish act-finance-q3 publishing is always high-stakes → human sign-off → mock-tallyport delivers
    phase 0             draft in ingest-only phase → held (phase-disabled)
