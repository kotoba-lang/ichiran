  "TallyGovernor — the independent censor that earns tally-LLM the right to
  *propose* a tally workbook draft. The LLM has no notion of tenant
  boundaries, redaction requirements, or the no-actuation charter, so this
  MUST be a separate system (rules over the store's ground facts) able to
  *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD — the ichiran analog of teian's
  BriefingGovernor / koyomi's ComplianceGovernor / kekkai's TailnetGovernor.

  The actor is **propose → draft only**. It never publishes a tally;
  publishing (`:tally/publish`) is ALWAYS routed to a human (the ichiran
  analog of teian's always-human `:deck/publish`). Below, HARD invariants
  force HOLD (a human cannot approve past a proposal for a nonexistent
  activity, a missing redaction on a sensitive cite, or a workbook declared
  for the WRONG tenant); a clean publish still routes to a human
  (high-stakes), at every phase.

  HARD invariants:
    :tally/draft
      1. Missing-subject  — the artifact (itonami activity) must already be
                             a registered ground fact. This is an
                             INDEPENDENT, UNCONDITIONAL check — it never
                             looks at the proposal's :content/:tenant to
                             decide whether to fire (an LLM can hallucinate
                             an id; the governor never trusts confidence
                             alone for this). Modeled fresh on koyomi's fixed
                             `missing-activity-violations` (koyomi.governor):
                             that check runs unconditionally, in the SAME
                             top-level `concat` as every other hard check,
                             so a nonexistent subject can never silently
                             no-op its way past tenant-isolation/redaction
                             (the class of gap koyomi's own review closed —
                             see koyomi.governor's docstring on
                             `missing-activity-violations`).
      2. No-actuation      — proposal :effect must be :draft (a control-
                             plane record), never :published.
      3. Redaction         — every sensitive-category cite (:financial/
                             :legal/:personnel) must appear in :redactions.
      4. Tenant-isolation  — the proposal's declared :tenant must equal the
                             artifact's own registered :repo (no cross-
                             tenant tally).
    :tally/publish
      1. Missing-subject   — same unconditional check as :tally/draft (the
                             artifact must already be registered).
      2. Missing-draft     — a draft must already have been committed (you
                             cannot publish a tally that was never
                             proposed).
      3. Redaction (recheck)      — re-runs the redaction check against the
                             CURRENTLY STORED draft (fetched fresh from the
                             store, not trusted from the incoming proposal) —
                             defense-in-depth against the draft having been
                             revised between draft-time approval and this
                             publish-time delivery (ADR-2607062030 amendment:
                             the exact TOCTOU gap teian's `:deck/publish`
                             review found and fixed — ichiran implements the
                             recheck from the start).
      4. Tenant-isolation (recheck) — same recheck, for the stored draft's
                             :tenant vs. the artifact's own :repo.
    (any op) — an unrecognized :op is itself a hard violation (fail-closed:
               a not-yet-wired op must never silently pass as clean).
  SOFT:
    Confidence floor → escalate.
    `:tally/publish` is high-stakes → ALWAYS human, independent of phase."
